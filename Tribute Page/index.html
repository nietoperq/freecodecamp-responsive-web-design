            <h2>Who Was Virginia Woolf?</h2>

            <p>
                Born into a privileged English household in 1882, author Virginia Woolf was raised by free-thinking
                parents. She began writing as a young girl and published her first novel, The Voyage Out, in 1915. She
                wrote modernist classics including Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse and Orlando, as well as pioneering
                feminist works, A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas. In her personal life, she suffered bouts of deep
                depression. She committed suicide in 1941, at the age of 59.
            </p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Born on January 25, 1882, Adeline Virginia Stephen was raised in a remarkable household. Her father, Sir
                Leslie Stephen, was a historian and author, as well as one of the most prominent figures in the golden
                age of mountaineering. Woolf's mother, Julia Prinsep Stephen (née Jackson), had been born in India and
                later served as a model for several Pre-Raphaelite painters. She was also a nurse and wrote a book on
                the profession. Both of her parents had been married and widowed before marrying each other. Woolf had
                three full siblings — Thoby, Vanessa and Adrian — and four half-siblings — Laura Makepeace Stephen and
                George, Gerald and Stella Duckworth. The eight children lived under one roof at 22 Hyde Park Gate,
                Kensington.
            </p>

            <p>
                Two of Woolf's brothers had been educated at Cambridge, but all the girls were taught at home and
                utilized the splendid confines of the family's lush Victorian library. Moreover, Woolf's parents were
                extremely well connected, both socially and artistically. Her father was a friend to William Thackeray,
                the father of his first wife who died unexpectedly, and George Henry Lewes, as well as many other noted
                thinkers. Her mother's aunt was the famous 19th century photographer Julia Margaret Cameron.
            </p>


            <p>From the time of her birth until 1895, Woolf spent her summers in St. Ives, a beach town at the very
                southwestern tip of England. The Stephens' summer home, Talland House, which is still standing today,
                looks out at the dramatic Porthminster Bay and has a view of the Godrevy Lighthouse, which inspired her
                writing. In her later memoirs, Woolf recalled St. Ives with a great fondness. In fact, she incorporated
                scenes from those early summers into her modernist novel, To the Lighthouse (1927).
            </p>

            <p>As a young girl, Virginia was curious, light-hearted and playful. She started a family newspaper, the
                Hyde Park Gate News, to document her family's humorous anecdotes. However, early traumas darkened her
                childhood, including being sexually abused by her half-brothers George and Gerald Duckworth, which she
                wrote about in her essays A Sketch of the Past and 22 Hyde Park Gate. In 1895, at the age of 13, she
                also had to cope with the sudden death of her mother from rheumatic fever, which led to her first mental
                breakdown, and the loss of her half-sister Stella, who had become the head of the household, two years
                later. </p>

            <p>While dealing with her personal losses, Woolf continued her studies in German, Greek and Latin at the
                Ladies' Department of King's College London. Her four years of study introduced her to a handful of
                radical feminists at the helm of educational reforms. In 1904, her father died from stomach cancer,
                which contributed to another emotional setback that led to Woolf being institutionalized for a brief
                period. Virginia Woolf's dance between literary expression and personal desolation would continue for
                the rest of her life. In 1905, she began writing professionally as a contributor for The Times Literary
                Supplement. A year later, Woolf's 26-year-old brother Thoby died from typhoid fever after a family trip
                to Greece. </p>

            <p>After their father's death, Woolf's sister Vanessa and brother Adrian sold the family home in Hyde Park
                Gate, and purchased a house in the Bloomsbury area of London. During this period, Virginia met several
                members of the Bloomsbury Group, a circle of intellectuals and artists including the art critic Clive
                Bell, who married Virginia's sister Vanessa, the novelist E.M. Forster, the painter Duncan Grant, the
                biographer Lytton Strachey, economist John Maynard Keynes and essayist Leonard Woolf, among others. The
                group became famous in 1910 for the Dreadnought Hoax, a practical joke in which members of the group
                dressed up as a delegation of Ethiopian royals, including Virginia disguised as a bearded man, and
                successfully persuaded the English Royal Navy to show them their warship, the HMS Dreadnought. After the
                outrageous act, Leonard Woolf and Virginia became closer, and eventually they were married on August 10,
                1912. The two shared a passionate love for one another for the rest of their lives.</p>

            <h2>Literary Work</h2>
            <p>
                Several years before marrying Leonard, Virginia had begun working on her first novel. The original title
                was Melymbrosia. After nine years and innumerable drafts, it was released in 1915 as The Voyage Out.
                Woolf used the book to experiment with several literary tools, including compelling and unusual
                narrative perspectives, dream-states and free association prose. Two years later, the Woolfs bought a
                used printing press and established Hogarth Press, their own publishing house operated out of their
                home, Hogarth House. Virginia and Leonard published some of their writing, as well as the work of
                Sigmund Freud, Katharine Mansfield and T.S. Eliot.
            </p>
            <p>
                A year after the end of World War I, the Woolfs purchased Monk's House, a cottage in the village of
                Rodmell in 1919, and that same year Virginia published Night and Day, a novel set in Edwardian England.
                Her third novel Jacob's Room was published by Hogarth in 1922. Based on her brother Thoby, it was
                considered a significant departure from her earlier novels with its modernist elements. That year, she
                met author, poet and landscape gardener Vita Sackville-West, the wife of English diplomat Harold
                Nicolson. Virginia and Vita began a friendship that developed into a romantic affair. Although their
                affair eventually ended, they remained friends until Virginia Woolf's death.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1925, Woolf received rave reviews for Mrs. Dalloway, her fourth novel. The mesmerizing story
                interweaved interior monologues and raised issues of feminism, mental illness and homosexuality in
                post-World War I England. Mrs. Dalloway was adapted into a 1997 film, starring Vanessa Redgrave, and
                inspired The Hours, a 1998 novel by Michael Cunningham and a 2002 film adaptation. Her 1928 novel, To
                the Lighthouse, was another critical success and considered revolutionary for its stream of
                consciousness storytelling.The modernist classic examines the subtext of human relationships through the
                lives of the Ramsay family as they vacation on the Isle of Skye in Scotland.
            </p>

            <p>Woolf found a literary muse in Sackville-West, the inspiration for Woolf's 1928 novel Orlando, which
                follows an English nobleman who mysteriously becomes a woman at the age of 30 and lives on for over
                three centuries of English history. The novel was a breakthrough for Woolf who received critical praise
                for the groundbreaking work, as well as a newfound level of popularity.
            </p>

            <p>In 1929, Woolf published A Room of One's Own, a feminist essay based on lectures she had given at women's
                colleges, in which she examines women's role in literature. In the work, she sets forth the idea that “A
                woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.” Woolf pushed narrative
                boundaries in her next work, The Waves (1931), which she described as "a play-poem" written in the
                voices of six different characters. Woolf published The Years, the final novel published in her lifetime
                in 1937, about a family's history over the course of a generation. The following year she published
                Three Guineas, an essay which continued the feminist themes of A Room of One's Own and addressed fascism
                and war.</p>

            <p>Throughout her career, Woolf spoke regularly at colleges and universities, penned dramatic letters, wrote
                moving essays and self-published a long list of short stories. By her mid-forties, she had established
                herself as an intellectual, an innovative and influential writer and pioneering feminist. Her ability to
                balance dream-like scenes with deeply tense plot lines earned her incredible respect from peers and the
                public alike. Despite her outward success, she continued to regularly suffer from debilitating bouts of
                depression and dramatic mood swings.</p>

            <h2>Suicide and Legacy</h2>
            <p>Woolf's husband, Leonard, always by her side, was quite aware of any signs that pointed to his wife's
                descent into depression. He saw, as she was working on what would be her final manuscript, Between the
                Acts (published posthumously in 1941),that she was sinking into deepening despair. At the time, World
                War II was raging on and the couple decided if England was invaded by Germany, they would commit suicide
                together, fearing that Leonard, who was Jewish, would be in particular danger. In 1940, the couple's
                London home was destroyed during the Blitz, the Germans bombing of the city. </p>

            <p>Unable to cope with her despair, Woolf pulled on her overcoat, filled its pockets with stones and walked
                into the River Ouse on March 28, 1941. As she waded into the water, the stream took her with it. The
                authorities found her body three weeks later. Leonard Woolf had her cremated and her remains were
                scattered at their home, Monk's House.</p>

            <p>Although her popularity decreased after World War II, Woolf's work resonated again with a new generation
                of readers during the feminist movement of the 1970s. Woolf remains one of the most influential authors
                of the 21st century.</p>
